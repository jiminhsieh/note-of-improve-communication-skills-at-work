## Tips to be candid and open

* Stick to facts, e.g. let metrics speak for themselves
* Assume best intentions, e.g. everyone wants the best experience for customers
* Get to the point, e.g. articulate a specific concern.
* Be objective, e.g. just because someone disagrees with you does NOT make them wrong!

* Collect feedback, e.g. ask for other opinions

## Tips to assert confidence

* Not afraid to disagree, e.g. learn to say no.
* Know your stuff, e.g. build up your subject matter expertise
* Speak with clarity, e.g. focus on the main point.
* Defend your point of view without being defensive, e.g. back up with data and anecdotal evidence.
* Own up to mistakes, e.g. no afraid to say you were wrong or you don't know.
* Seek feedback, e.g. welcome challenges
* Show respect, e.g. treat less senior team members with equal respect.

## Tips to control your emotions

* Have clear goals in mind, e.g. what are you trying to get out of a conversation or meeting? 
* Pause to collect your thoughts, e.g. don't feel that you need to rush into responding.
* Willing to compromise, e.g. finding a middle ground might be the path forward.
* Look for humor in a dire situation, e.g. don't take yourself or a topic too seriously.
* Agree to disagree, e.g. table a conversation that's not going anywhere to determine next course of action.

## Other tips to improve communication generally

* Learn to speak in public, e.g. there are ample resources available to help such as Toastmasters.
* Take professional or business writing classes to improve written communication.
* Prepare before an important meeting, e.g. write down key points on a piece of paper.
* Practice with your peers and friends, e.g. dry-runs before a formal presentation always helps.
* Write better emails, e.g. your manager and co-workers will recognize and appreciate it.
* Find mentors, e.g. use your formal and informal mentors for coaching and guidance.
